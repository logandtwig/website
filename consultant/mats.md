description: Mats is an experienced backend developer focusing on cloud development in AWS using GoLang. He is a curious geek who loves to expand his horizons as a developer both at home and at work. When Mats is not busy working on one of his home projects he loves to workout, cook the juciest burgers in town (according to himself) or just hangout with some friends over a couple of beers.
